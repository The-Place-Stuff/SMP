### Impaling Enchantment (1.21+)
* Functions the way it does on Bedrock, meaning it affects mobs or players that are either touching water fluid blocks or are **visually** in contact with rain.
* Additional damage calculations have changed. (2.5 per level -> 2.0 per level)

### Multishot Enchantment (1.21+)
* Is now marked as a treasure enchantment, and can no longer be obtained through trading, enchanting and mob loot.
* Can **only** be obtained from raids.

### Raids
* Pillagers after wave 5 have a chance to spawn with multishot crossbows.
* Illager mobs (while a raid is active) can now drop the following enchanted books:
    * Sharpness
    * Smite
    * Looting
    * Quick Charge
    * Multishot
    * Unbreaking
* The chances of obtaining an enchanted book increase with looting.
